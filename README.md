# Official Provider Template

`upjet-provider-template` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider that
is built using [Upjet](https://github.com/upbound/upjet) code
generation tools and exposes XRM-conformant managed resources for the
Template API.

## Getting Started

Install the provider by using the following command after changing the image tag
to the [latest release](https://github.com/upbound/upjet-provider-template/releases):
```
kubectl crossplane install provider upbound/upjet-provider-template:v0.1.0
```

Alternatively, you can use declarative installation:
```
kubectl apply -f examples/install.yaml
```

Notice that in this example Provider resource is referencing ControllerConfig with debug enabled.

You can see the API reference [here](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/upbound/upjet-provider-template).
